   <p class="default"> This is a rotten tomatoes review of Parks and Rec. I like this review because it ranks the show highly and it is correct.</p>

    <p class="default">This review is more for parents. It claims that the show is suited for kids thirteen and up. I agree with this as their are some more adult jokes present in the show.</p>

<p class="default">This review sucks. It is wrong. The seventh season is great, and there is nothing wrong with a goofy lighthearted sitcom having a super happy ending.</p>

<p class="default">This review is entirely right. In season one the show hadn't quite found its groove yet but was still funny.</p>

<p class="default">The user reviews on metacritic give Parks and Rec a justified 8.5, but critics only gave it a 67. This is because critics are idiots.</p>
