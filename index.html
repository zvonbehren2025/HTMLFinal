    <p class="alt"> Parks and Recreation is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Made by the creators of the office, the show aired from 2009 to 2015. It ran for 125 episodes and 7 seasons. The show revolvs around Leslie Knope (Amy Pohler,) a very hard worker in the very diffcult of mid level small town government.</p>

<br>
    <p class="alt">If you would like to start watching the show it is availible on Peacock for free with ads. The first two seasons of the show are not as good as the other five. This was mainly due to the show not yet having a distinct identity from the Office. However, once Parks and Rec found a unique vibe it flourished, and does not let up for the rest of the show. </p>
